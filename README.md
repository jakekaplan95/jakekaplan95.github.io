**Pokedex API Project**

**Technologies Used**
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- JQuery
- Ajax

**Approach**

1. First, I attempted to hard code the data for a single pokemon into the web page, taking code that I wanted from the API, pasting it into my own script.js, and making sure that the information was displayed on screen.
2. Next, I kept using just the information for one Pokemon but connected to the Pokemon API to pull the information over.
3. Lastly, after succesfully pulling information from the API I set the functionality of the generate button to read the text box and filter the API to generate each of the 151 pokemon. Also added was error reponses for when either nothing is input into the text box or an erroneous value was input.

**Future Adjustments**

There are a few things I would like to add right off the bat. First, some more css. I would like to have done more with the actual look of the site, pictures etc. Next on the list to add would be a popup picture of the pokemon who's information is currently being displayed. Another added functionality I would work on is for the evolution chain for the pokemon to be displayed as well as the pokemon's specific type advantages and weaknesses.
